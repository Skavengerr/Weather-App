## Assumptions and thoughts on this project

I have not implemented any unit tests, I know it was mentioned in the description but I started to run out of time.<br>
The main reason why I was pushed for time was because Yahoo have changed their API which now requires oAuth authentication.<br>
I ran into the CORS problem and instead of using JSONP I instead decided to install a Chrome Extension called [Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: \*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi) <br>
The Yahoo documentation was not very helpful so I had to find an oAuth library to help.

If I had longer I would have implemented unit tests (Jest) & Snapshot testing.<br>
I used Semantic UI for the HTML components, it would have been nice to use Material UI but I would not have completed it in a reasonable timeframe if I did.

Improvements to be made:
Change the dropdown to an autocomplete and integrate with an address API<br>
There are a couple of good libs offering weather icons which have helped to give a nicer looking UI.<br>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
